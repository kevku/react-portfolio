# React Portfolio

This project was created as part of my journey to learn the basics of React, specifically focusing on components and state management.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Understand the fundamentals of **React components**.
- Learn how to use **state** to manage dynamic content.
- Explore how **reusable components** can automate repeated patterns across pages and smaller components on the screen.
- Build a **Single Page Application** (SPA) using React.

## What I Learned

- **Component-based architecture**: React components allow for breaking down the UI into independent, reusable pieces. I discovered how efficient this is for both page-level components and smaller UI elements.
- **State management**: React's state helped me manage dynamic behavior in the app, making it more interactive.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Through React, I learned the benefits of building SPAs, where navigation feels smooth without full page reloads.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by my desire to expand my web development skills beyond the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Coming from a **Web Client Languages** course, I wanted to explore how React could improve my approach to frontend development, especially for more complex and interactive applications.

I also wanted to **showcase some of the most interesting projects** I’ve worked on. Through this portfolio, I was able to highlight the diversity of my work, from web applications to design challenges. Each project serves as a reflection of the skills I’ve developed and the problems I’ve solved.

## Key Features

- **Responsive design**: The portfolio adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Reusable components**: From headers to project cards, React allowed me to reuse components efficiently across different sections of the portfolio.
- **Client-side routing**: Using React Router, the portfolio behaves like a multi-page app, even though it’s a single page at its core.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The main framework for building the portfolio.
- **React Router**: For client-side navigation between sections.
- **CSS Modules**: To style the components locally, ensuring no conflicts across different styles.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment.
